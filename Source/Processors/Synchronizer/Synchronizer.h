    Uses events across multiple streams

    One incoming stream is set as the "main" stream,
    which is used to determine the clock start time.
    The main stream's sample rate is treated as ground
    truth, and all other streams clocks are scaled
    to align with this one.

    The synchronizer works best when the sync line
    has a TTL pulse with a relatively slow inter-event
    interval (e.g. 1 Hz). This interval does not have
    to be regular, however.
